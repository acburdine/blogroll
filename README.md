## Documentation

the blogroll page comes with a few files:

- `assets` contains all CSS and JS needed to make the page work
- `index.html` is the actual page
- `bloglist.json` is the data needed for the blog list

To add blogs to the list, open `bloglist.json` in a text editor.

#### bloglist.json structure

- "name": The name for your blogroll. Used in the title of the page as well as a header
- "description": A short description of your blogroll. Also goes in the header
- "blogs": An object containing the list of blogs. Each key in the object is the blog link, and the value is a short description of what the blog is.
